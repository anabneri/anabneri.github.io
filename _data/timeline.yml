- title: Bandtec - Analysis and Development of Systems
  from: 2018
  to: 2019
  description: Finalizing in ten/2019! Bandtec was a college that made me grow a lot like
              Person and professional. In it I learned to develop my socio-emotional and technical qualities that I have today
              I owe a lot and all the teachers who helped me and help me build my journey to this day,
              I remember I was very insecure about the career of T. I in this college I found that I can
              Much more than I believe!

- title: Etec Jorge Street - High and Technical School
  from: 2015
  to: 2017
  description: At 14 I decided to make Etec, integrated a technician to high school.
              It was a nice experience, where I enjoyed Industrial automation, build 
              My love for IoT (where I had contact with Arduino and microcontrollers and related).
              And that's where I built my logic, because the materials of the technician demanded knowledge
              of mathematics and college level physics at least.
              I owe a lot to all the professors of Jorge Street, thanks to them I am who I am today!
