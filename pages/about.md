# **About Me**

Heeeey THERE, I'm Ana Beatriz, <br>
**How it all started** <br>
-It all worked out when I won my first notebook, and I made an account at TUMBLR. I always had a lot of curiosity, inspected element, played with HTML by browser etc.. That's when I found out I could make my own themes :D For a 12-year-old teenager, it was paradise. <br><br>
**"Do not know how to program "** <br>
-When I got into college, I didn't think I was good at programming, so I didn't. It was an interesting period, having my first internship and seeing that what I thought was the career of my life is actually not. <br> <br>
**" I know how to program "** <br>
My dream was always able to give my family a better life, and I wanted to change jobs. That's when I gave myself 100% to really learn how to program, I put my faces... Today I'm allocated as Java developer, a huge achievement for me that I thought I could not! <br><br>
**Keep in touch** <br>
I don't have the most beautiful history in the world, but I have people who made it exist, like: my parents, without them I wouldn't be what I'm today and what I seek to be every day! And my tech leaders too, a lot of people help me grow technologically every day. <br> <br>
