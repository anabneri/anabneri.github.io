# **About Me**

Heeeey THERE, I'm Ana Beatriz * *, <br>
* * How it all started * * <br>
-It all worked out when I won my first notebook, and I made an account at TUMBR. I always had a lot of curiosity, inspected element, played with HTML by browser etc.. That's when I found out I could make my own themes:D For a 12-year-old teenager, it was paradise. <br><br>
* * Music * * <br>
-Music inspires me, I play the violin since I was 8 years old, so for a period I left my blog and my themes aside to devote myself more. But it demanded a lot of effort. My parents couldn't afford to pay for violin lessons so I did it for free by the government, when school closed for lack of funds I went to study alone, but. After that I joined Etec and saw my time was little, I went to practice much less and leave this dream aside... <br><br>
* *  "Do not know how to program " * * <br>
-When I got into college, I didn't think I was good at programming, so I didn't. It was an interesting period, having my first internship and seeing that what I thought was the career of my life is actually not. <br> <br>
* *  "I know how to program " * * <br>
My Soho was always able to give my family a better life, and I wanted to change jobs. That's when I gave myself 100% to really learn how to program, I put my faces... Today I am allocated as Java developer, a huge achievement for me that I thought I could not! <br><br>
* * Keep in touch * * <br>
-I do not have the most beautiful hisory in the world, but I have people who made it exist, like: my parents, without them I would not be what I am today and what I seek to be every day! And my tech leaders too, a lot of people help me grow technologically every day. <br> <br>
